## Features

![screenshot macOS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renebigot/marvin-logger/master/img/mac.png)

`marvin-logger` is a simple, effective, colorful and cross-platform logger for nodejs which:

* Log to console
* Log to file
* "Rotate" log files
* Create one file per PID (usefull for clustered app)
* Colorize logs by levels (debug, info, warning, error, important, http)


## Install

`npm install --save ${pkg.name}`


## Usage

Include library and create a logger instance. By default, you'll log only to your console.

```javascript
var Marvin = require('marvin-logger'),
    logger = new Marvin();
```

To log to file, you have to define the output directory:

```javascript
var Marvin = require('marvin-logger'),
    logger = new Marvin({
      logOutputDirectory: './logs'
    });
```

Log some debug data : 

```javascript
logger.debug('[debug] message');
logger.debug('Another debug message with object', {foo: 'bar'});
```

`debug()` can be replaced with `info()`, `warn()`, `error()`, `important()` and `http()`. Every methods use the same syntax as `console.log()`.

You can define a minimal log level by passing the `level` option to Marvin:

```javascript
var Marvin = require('marvin-logger'),
    logger = new Marvin({
      level: 'error',
      logOutputDirectory: './logs'
    });
```

In this example, only `error()`, `important()` and `http()` will be able to display information.

`important()` and `http()` are always shown. You can use them to display important data like critical states or http access (or what ever you want).
